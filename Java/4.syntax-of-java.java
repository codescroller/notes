/* 
-: Java Syntax
==========
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
    }

    - Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class
    - The name of the java file must match the class name with ".java" extension. 
    - The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
    - System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
    - You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).

// Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
