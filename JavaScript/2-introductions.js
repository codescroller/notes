/*
Q) What is JavaScript?
=============
JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
“Chakra” for IE, 
“JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
